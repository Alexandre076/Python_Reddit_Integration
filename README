# Reddit Integration Application

This application fetches posts from specified subreddits and stores them in a SQLite database. It is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Docker Compose installed (optional, but recommended for managing multiple containers)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexandre076/Python_Reddit_Integration.git
cd <your-repository-directory>

### 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run:
docker build -t py_reddit_integration .

### 3. Edit the docker-compose.yml File
Edit the docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project directory. 
This file can be configured so the integration is able to deploy as many instances you would like. 
Each instance can download a list of subreddits. Bellow is an example of how to do so:

version: '3'
services:
  reddit_instance1:
    image: py_reddit_integration
    command: python main.py "computerscience,pics"
    volumes:
      - ${USERPROFILE}/reddit_db:/app/db
  reddit_instance2:
    image: py_reddit_integration
    command: python main.py "brazil,funny"
    volumes:
      - ${USERPROFILE}/reddit_db:/app/db

### 4. Run the Application
To start the application with Docker Compose, use the following command:
docker-compose up -d

### 5. Check Running Containers
To see the running containers, you can use:
docker ps

### 6. Stop the Application
To stop all running instances, run:
docker-compose down

### 7. Accessing Logs
To view logs from a specific instance, you can use:
docker-compose logs reddit_instance1

### 8. Persisting Data
The SQLite database (reddit_tracker.db) and activity log (activity.log) will be stored in your user directory under reddit_db for persistence. You can find them in:
C:\Users\<your-username>\reddit_db\

### 9. Running the code locally without Docker.
In case you prefer to run the code locally, without containers use the following guidelines:
- Open the terminal on the root directory of this application.
- Run the following command: python setup_and_run.py
